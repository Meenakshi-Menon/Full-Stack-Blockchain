## 📖 Overview

This project was developed to explore the fundamentals of blockchain by building an actual working model using only JavaScript and open-source web technologies. Rather than relying on pre-existing frameworks like Ethereum or Bitcoin libraries, every key element was coded manually to deeply understand how blockchains work behind the scenes.

The app features:

- A custom-built blockchain backend
- A transaction system with wallet signing
- Mining through proof-of-work
- Real-time peer syncing via publish/subscribe
- A modern web frontend using React
- Deployment on Heroku for public access

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas to make the app more scalable and production-ready:

- 💾 Save blockchain data to the local file system or persistent database
- 📥 Reload the chain from JSON to resume previous states
- 🔁 Switch from polling to WebSocket for live transaction updates
- 📦 State management using Redux for better frontend performance
- 🔑 Generate fresh key pairs per transaction for better privacy
- 🔍 Show mining progress in real-time on the frontend
- 🛂 Secure the frontend with authentication & role-based access
- 🧩 Implement permissioned chains with limited user access
- 🧠 Use AI models for anomaly detection in transactions
- 🌱 Explore Proof-of-Stake implementation for eco-friendliness
